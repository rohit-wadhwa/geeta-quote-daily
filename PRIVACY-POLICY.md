# Privacy Policy for Geeta Quote Daily Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: 20-March-2024**

Thank you for choosing Geeta Quote Daily ("we", "us", "our"). Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding information handling when you use the Geeta Quote Daily Chrome Extension (the "Extension"). We encourage you to read this privacy policy carefully. If you disagree with any part of this policy, please discontinue the use of the Extension.

## Information We Collect

The Extension enriches your new tab with daily inspirational quotes from the Bhagavad Gita, alongside serene visuals and optional soothing background music. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from its users. The Extension operates entirely locally on your device, and no user registration or collection of personal identifiers is involved.

## Permissions We Use

Our extension requires several permissions to provide its functionality. Here's how each permission is used:

### Storage Permission
- Saves your preferences locally (language selection, music settings, rain effect status)
- Caches quote data for offline use and reduced API calls
- Remembers your last viewed background between sessions
- Stores timestamp of quote refreshes to maintain daily schedule
- All storage is local to your device and is not transmitted elsewhere

### Alarms Permission
- Schedules daily quote refreshes at midnight
- Ensures timely updates of inspirational content
- Manages resource cleanup intervals for optimal performance
- All alarms operate locally and do not involve data collection

### Host Permissions
- **vedicscriptures.github.io**: Accesses the Bhagavad Gita API for quotes and chapter information
- **saavncdn.com**: Streams Krishna flute background music
- **assets.mixkit.co**: Accesses rain sound effects for the magic rain feature
- **img.buymeacoffee.com**: Displays the "Buy Me a Coffee" support button
- These permissions are used solely to fetch content that enhances your experience, with no user data collected or sent to these domains

## How We Use Your Information

Since our Extension does not collect personal information, there is no utilization of such information. Any preferences or settings are stored locally on your device and used only to customize your experience with the Extension.

## Sharing Your Information

We do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose any personal information to third parties, as we do not collect any personal information through our Extension.

## Security of Your Information

Protecting user information is a priority for us. Even though our Extension does not collect personal information, we are committed to ensuring the security of our Extension against unauthorized access or use.

## Your Consent

By using our Extension, you consent to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time for any reason. Any updates will be indicated by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Extension's page, and you waive the right to specific notice of each such modification.

We advise you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed of any updates. Your continued use of the Extension after the posting of an updated privacy policy constitutes your agreement to be bound by and acceptance of the policy changes.
